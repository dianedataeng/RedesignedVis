## Project Overview

This is a graduate-level project in which I redesigned the CDC’s visualization of opioid dispensing rates across the United States. Using **R** and **Quarto**, I created:

- **An interactive stacked bar chart** comparing 2019 and 2023 rates by state.
- **A heat map** illustrating changes in opioid dispensing between 2019 and 2023.

The redesign focuses on enhancing clarity and insight by highlighting:

- **Geographic patterns** across the U.S.
- **Temporal changes** over time.
- **State-level differences** in opioid dispensing.
