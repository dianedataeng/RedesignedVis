    "text": "Original State Map of Opioid Dispensing Rates\n\n\n\nSource: Centers for Disease Control, State Opioid Dispensing Rates https://www.cdc.gov/overdose-prevention/data-research/facts-stats/opioid-dispensing-rate-maps.html\n\n\nThe map shows retail pharmacy dispensed opioid prescriptions per 100 persons per year in 2019 and 2023. The current CDC map of opioid dispensing rates uses four fixed categories (&lt;34.9, 34.9–42.0, 42.1–51.7, &gt;51.7). While simple, this approach has several key problems:\n\nObscures variation: The top category (&gt;51.7) lumps together rates from 52 to 71. This means states with moderately high rates and those with extremely high rates appear identical, hiding important differences.\n\nFor example, in 2023, Kansas had a dispensing rate of 52.8, while Arkansas was much higher at 71.5 — yet both appear identical on the map.\n\nIgnores change over time: The map only shows a single year and does not reveal how rates have changed from 2019 to 2023, preventing understanding of trends or improvements across states.\nStatic thresholds distort trends: Using the same cutoffs across years can make overall increases or decreases invisible, since many states may shift within a category without any visual change on the map.\nColor choice issues: Using only a few discrete colors for broad categories reduces the map’s ability to reflect subtle differences, making it harder to distinguish states with similar rates or identify regional patterns.\nOverall, the current map’s categorical bins and limited color scheme oversimplify the data and fail to communicate both the magnitude of high rates and temporal trends, making it less useful for analysis or policy insights.\n\n\n\n📊Stacked Bar Graph Redesign\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe stacked bar graph compares opioid dispensing rates between 2019 and 2023 for each state, highlighting how rates have changed over time.\nYou can toggle between 2019, 2023, or view both years together to see trends more clearly.\nThis design highlights both the absolute rates and the change over time, making it easy to see which states made the greatest progress and which showed minimal change or slight increases.\nBy displaying both years in one interactive chart, the visualization helps viewers quickly identify national patterns and understand how opioid dispensing rates have shifted over the four-year period.\nKey Features:\n\nHighlights the decrease in opioid dispensing rates over time.\nAllows viewers to toggle between 2019, 2023, or display both years together.\nThe graph shows both the 2019 baseline and the 2023 value, making it easy to compare absolute rates.\nYou can quickly identify which states had the largest decreases, as well as states with minimal change or slight increases.\nProvides a direct, data-driven view of national trends and state-level progress.\n\n\n\n🗺️ Heat Map Redesign\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe heat map visualizes opioid dispensing rates across the U.S., using color intensity to show severity — the darker the red, the more severe the rate in that state.\nKey Features:\n\nRed indicates higher rates, with darker red showing the most severe dispensing levels.\nUses a continuous color scale instead of categories, showing the full range of values.\nAllows viewers to toggle between 2019 and 2023, making changes over time easy to see.\nMakes it easier to identify regional clusters of high opioid dispensing.\nHighlights where opioid dispensing is most concentrated across the country.\nProvides a more detailed and nuanced view than the original CDC map."
