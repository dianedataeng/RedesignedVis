title: "Visualizing Insight: Redesigning Data Visualizations"
---

## 👋 Welcome

This project focuses on evaluating a real-world data visualization, identifying its limitations, and creating redesigned versions that enhance clarity, interpretability, and insight.

Using publicly available opioid dispensing data from the **Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC)**, I redesigned the original visualization to better highlight:

-   Geographic patterns across the U.S.
-   Temporal changes over time
-   State-level differences in opioid dispensing

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## 📌 Project Overview

### 🎯 Objective

The objective of this project is to **identify an existing real-world visualization**, analyze its limitations, and create **multiple redesigned versions** that improve clarity, interpretability, and insight within the original context.

Using publicly available opioid dispensing data from the **Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC)**, I selected an existing visualization and produced redesigned charts that better highlight:

-   Geographic patterns
-   Changes over time
-   Differences across U.S. states

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## 📊 Original Visualization & Redesigns

### Original Visualization

The original visualization displayed U.S. opioid dispensing rates but made it difficult to:

-   Compare trends across states
-   Identify regional patterns
-   Clearly interpret changes between years

### Redesigned Visualizations

I created several redesigned visualizations, including:

-   A **heat map** to reveal geographic and intensity-based patterns
-   A **stacked bar chart** to highlight changes between 2019 and 2023

Each redesign is accompanied by a **comparative analysis** discussing the strengths and weaknesses of both the original and redesigned plots, with attention to audience and context.
